Hi! 🤗

I'm Amal, a Symfony Developer from Tunisia.
I hold a Master’s degree in Media Engineering.

Leveraging my web development skills and graphic design background, I create custom solutions tailored to my clients’ specific needs.

As a native Arabic speaker fluent in French and English, I can build effective multilingual applications with cultural insight.

Outside of coding, you'll often find me in the kitchen —I love cooking 👩‍🍳— or reading psychology and self-development books.
I also enjoy sharing tech-related content on social media.
